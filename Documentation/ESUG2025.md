Branch prediction is based on the current PC, so a threaded word for send will have jumps to the various locations from a fixed location, so branch prediction becomes useless. Localizing branches is probably the biggest win from Copy&Patch JIT. Could do a very simple experiment on C&P by when it is about to do the jump, instead jump to a fixed point that does the indirect jump - whatever slowdown we see would be the failure of branch prediction.
