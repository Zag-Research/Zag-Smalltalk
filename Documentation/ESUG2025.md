Branch prediction is based on the current PC, so a threaded word for send will have jumps to the various locations from a fixed location, so branch prediction becomes useless. Localizing branches is probably the biggest win from Copy&Patch JIT. Could do a very simple experiment on C&P by when it is about to do the jump, instead jump to a fixed point that does the indirect jump - whatever slowdown we see would be the failure of branch prediction.

[StackOverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array) has a lot of good explanation inclusinng this useful extract:
Let’s measure the performance of this loop with different conditions:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < max; i++)
    if (condition)
        sum++;
```

Here are the timings of the loop with different true-false patterns:

```r
Condition                Pattern             Time (ms)
-------------------------------------------------------
(i & 0×80000000) == 0    T repeated          322

(i & 0xffffffff) == 0    F repeated          276

(i & 1) == 0             TF alternating      760

(i & 3) == 0             TFFFTFFF…           513

(i & 2) == 0             TTFFTTFF…           1675

(i & 4) == 0             TTTTFFFFTTTTFFFF…   1275

(i & 8) == 0             8T 8F 8T 8F …       752

(i & 16) == 0            16T 16F 16T 16F …   490
```
