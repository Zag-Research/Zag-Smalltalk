There is a tool called [vale](https://vale.sh/) that checks prose for style and readability. It is described [here](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2024/07/29/using-vale-to-improve-my-writing/) and [here](https://www.meilisearch.com/blog/prose-linting-with-vale). It would be good to check our documentation. There is even an (old, doesn't currently work) [plugin for Obsidian](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-vale/tree/main/src) - if someone wanted to update it for the current Obsidian editor.
