The way symbols are used is that they have a 24-bit hash that is uniformly distributed, despite there being considerably fewer that 2^24 symbols. This is used in hashing into the dispatch table for a class. The 24 bits can be thought of as a fixed-point decimal with the binary point left of the 24th bit. This make it a uniformly distributed number in the range `[0..1)`. So multiplying by the size of an array (`n`) and shifting out the "fractional" portion gives a number in the range `[0..n)`. This replaces a slow divide with a multiply and shift.

Symbols are allocated sequentially, 1, 2, 3, ... and then a hash function is applied to generate a 24-bit uniformly distributed number. The hash function needs to be invertible so that we can go from a symbol's hash code back to the index into the symbol table.

## Weyl sequences
As of August 2025, the conversion of the index number of a symbol into its hash value uses a [Weyl sequence](https://marc-b-reynolds.github.io/math/2016/02/24/weyl.html) using `1/phi` as the irrational number. This uses an integer multiplication of the index by the 24-bit finite approximation (10368889). While this doesn't produce a "random" number, it produces a uniformly distributed quasirandom number that is used for the "random" tag for a node in the treap that is used to look up strings to convert to symbols.

This function is invertible by multiplying by the inverse mod 1 of the index above (11764425).
## Triple32 sequences
[Christopher Wellons](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/07/31/) did an [exploration](https://github.com/skeeto/hash-prospector) of hashing functions with the properties above. A 24-bit version of this would be theoretically better. But it would be a bit slower (although new symbol generation isn't that common).
